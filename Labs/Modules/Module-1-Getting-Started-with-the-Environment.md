### Instructions 

1. After the environment is provisioned successfully your browser will load up the **Lab Guide** along with a virtual machine called **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**. This virtual machine will be your platform throughout the course of the workshop. In case you do not see the **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** load up on the left side of the screen, navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab on the top right of the **Lab Guide** and check the status of the virtual machine. Alternatively, you can directly RDP into labvm using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab.
